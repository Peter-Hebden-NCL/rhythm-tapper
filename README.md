# Rhythm Tapper source code

**This is a template for a poetry interface that uses sound to 'tap out' the rhythm of the words of a poem, using tagging of the words' stressed and unstressed syllables.**



### Content

This code repository contains the HTML and JS file for the interface, along with the sound and image assets. It also contains a Python script that uses the Pronouncing library to generate the tagging of stressed and unstressed syllables in the text. 

The poems in this interface have been replaced with placeholder text, which is clearly marked in the index.js file.
