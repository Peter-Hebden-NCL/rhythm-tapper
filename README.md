# rhythm-tapper

**This is a template for a poetry interface that uses sound to 'tap out' the rhythm of the words of a poem, using tagging of the words' stressed and unstressed syllables.**



### <!--Content-->

<!--This code repository contains the files for the audio map, minus four audio files, which need to be supplied in order to test the interface. These should be added at the root directory and referenced in the index.html file within the $(document).ready() function at the end of the file.-->

<!--The interface uses an image-map to trigger sound. These are generated in HTML by a string of co-ordinates that map on top of a displayed image. The image and image-map can be replaced to customise the interface for your own needs. The co-ordinates are held within the <map> tag in the index.html file.-->

<!--Debug features can be turned on by changing #debug to 'display:block' in CSS. This will allow you to see the volume of each track and the cursor's distance from its point on the map.-->

<!--Password is 'password'. This is not intended as a strong security feature and can be removed or changed in the index.html file.-->
